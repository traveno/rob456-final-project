		is in the robot's coordinate frame.  The x-axis is positive-forwards, and the y-axis is
		positive to the left.

		The example sets constant velocities, which is clearly the wrong thing to do.  Replace this
		code with something that moves the robot more intelligently.

		Parameters:
			target:		The current target point, in the coordinate frame of the robot (base_link) as
						an (x, y) tuple.
			lidar:		A LaserScan containing the new lidar data.

		Returns:
			A Twist message, containing the commanded robot velocities.
