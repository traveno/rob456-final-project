		the robot is making progress towards it's goal, then you might want to check that the distance to
		the goal is generally going down.  If you want to change where the robot is heading to, you can
		make a call to set_waypoints here.  This call will override the current set of waypoints, and the
		robot will start to drive towards the first waypoint in the new list.

		Parameters:

		the robot to follow, you can pass it to the driver code using set_waypoints().  Again, this will
		override any current set of waypoints that you might have previously sent.

		Parameters:
			point:		A PointStamped containing the position of the robot, in the map coordinate frame.
			map:		An OccupancyGrid containing the current version of the map.
			map_data:	A MapMetaData containing the current map meta data.
